# 🐍 160 Days of Python – Daily Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **#160DaysOfCode** journey where I solve a new Python problem each day to improve my logic, consistency, and coding skills.

## 🧠 Day 1: Reverse a Number in Python 🔁

### 🚀 Problem:
Write a Python program to reverse a number entered by the user.

### ✅ Goal:
- Break the number into digits
- Reverse the digits
- Construct and print the reversed number

---

### 🔍 Example:
**Input:** `12345`  
**Output:** `54321`

---

### 🧩 Approach:
1. Convert the number to a list of digits using `str()` and list comprehension.
2. Reverse the list manually using a loop.
3. Construct the reversed number mathematically.

---

### 🎯 What I Learned:
- Breaking numbers into digits using `str()` and `int()`
- List comprehension
- Reversing logic with loops
- Rebuilding integers from digits

---

## 🧠 Day 2: Sum of Digits in Python 🔢

### 🚀 Problem:
Write a Python program to find the sum of digits of any number (positive, negative, or zero).

### ✅ Goal:
- Handle negative input using `abs()`
- Convert number into digits
- Calculate the sum of digits using `sum()`

---

### 🔍 Example:
**Input:** `-432`  
**Output:** `9`

---

### 🧩 Approach:
1. Use `abs()` to ignore the sign.
2. Convert the number to a string and map each digit to `int`.
3. Use `sum()` on the list of digits.

- [`Day02_SumOfDigits.py`](https://github.com/danishkhan00786/160--day-of-python/blob/main/Day02_SumOfDigits.py)

---

### 🎯 What I Learned:
- Using `abs()` for negative inputs
- List comprehension to convert strings to integers
- Python’s `sum()` function for total value

## 🧠 Day 3: Prime Number Checker 🔍✅

**Problem:**  
Check whether a given number is a **prime number**.

**✅ Goal:**  
Efficiently determine if a number is prime using the square root method.

**🎯 Learning Outcome:**
- Understood that **prime numbers** are only divisible by 1 and themselves  
- Used `range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1)` for optimized iteration  
- Handled edge cases like 0, 1, and negative numbers

🧠 Day 4 of #160DaysOfCode – Sum of Squares using Python! 🟦📐

Continuing my Python problem-solving journey with another challenge that sharpens logic and builds muscle memory.

🚀 Problem:
Calculate the sum of squares from 0 to a given non-negative number.

✅ Goal:
Square each number in the range and sum them up.

🎯 Learning Outcome:

Used range(n+1) to include the upper limit

Applied lambda with map() for square calculation

Validated user input with try-except and basic checks

Practiced clean and readable coding style
